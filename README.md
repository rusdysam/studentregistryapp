## REST API - Student Registry App
REST API for Student Registry App - This API allows you to work with student data easily. You can create, read, update, and delete student records. It also ensures secure access through authentication and authorization.

Main Features:
- Manage Students: Add, view, update, and remove student information.
- User Authentication: Secure access to the API.
- Retrieve Data: Get student details like names, and addresses.

 For your convenience, we've provided a Postman JSON collection that you can import into your Postman workspace to test the API endpoints effectively.
